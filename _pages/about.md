Since Aug. 2022, Ziqi Yin (Â∞πÊ¢ìÁê¶) is pursuing his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), under the supervision of [Prof. Cong Gao](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong/).  Prior to that, he received his bachelor degree  in computer science from [BIT](https://bit.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [RongHua Li](https://ronghuali.github.io/ronghuali.html). He also worked in [PKU](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) as a research assistant with Prof. [Bin Cui](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/) and Doc. [Wentao Zhang](https://zwt233.github.io/) in 2021.

Motivated by the industrial demand, Ziqi's research focuses on large-scale graph deep learning and heuristic graph algorithm. He has published 3 papers. His research works have been powering several billion-scale applications in Tencent.
