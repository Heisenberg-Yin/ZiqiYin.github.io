I am a Ph.D. student at the [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), now working with [Prof. Bin Cui](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~cuibin/).

Research Interests
---
Graph Machine Learning from the following three perspectives:
+ **Data**: data privacy, data collection, data generation and data correction.

+ **Model**: scalable and deep GNN, distillation.

+ **System**: large-scale distributed training, AutoML.
